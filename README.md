# Independent AI Projects Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Independent AI Projects Repository. This collection showcases a variety of projects I've undertaken to explore and deepen my understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs), and data science. Each project, created and tested on Google Colaboratory, addresses different challenges and applications within the AI/ML domain.

## Projects Overview

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- **AI Integrity Shield**: A study on ensuring AI systems' integrity.
- **AI System for Processing Customer Feedback**: Analyzes customer feedback across e-communication channels.
- **Collecting Customer Feedback from Websites**: Techniques for gathering direct customer feedback online.
- **Linear and Logistic Regression**: Basic applications to data analysis and classification problems.
- **Lora Trainer**: A training module for an AI/ML model named Lora.
- **Model Fine-Tuning with BERT**: Advanced techniques for optimizing BERT model performance.
- **Natural Language Processing with RNNs**: Utilizing RNNs for processing natural language data.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation for Mitigating "Hallucination"**: Solutions to the hallucination problem in generative AI models.
- **STR Algorithms**: Exploration of Short Tandem Repeat algorithms in DNA analysis.
- **Utility Snippets for Importing Libraries**: A collection of commonly used library import snippets.
- **Workshop on Causal Inference**: Insights from a causal inference workshop.
- **Analysis of Price Trends and Forecasting Purchases**: Applying regression and LSTM models for financial analysis.
- **Food Safety Project**: Investigating food safety standards with AI.
- **Understanding Representation Models in LLMs**: A deep dive into representation techniques in language models.
- **Classifying Technology-Related Sentences**: Determining whether sentences are related to technology.
- **And more...**

        "Teacher model distillation in education is grounded in the broader field of knowledge distillation (KD) in machine learning. It involves transferring knowledge from a large, complex \"teacher\" model to a smaller, more efficient \"student\" model. In educational contexts, this process aims to create compact models that can be deployed in resource-constrained environments while maintaining high performance.\n",
